# Changes

This is the Yellow Squad implementation of EV3RTOS hrp2 beta 7.3 version.
It includes the addition of RB3rt library for c++ with labView like functions and color sensor raw reflected function.

Also this folder (YS-ev3rt-hrp2) has to be placed under ~/EV3RT/ otherwise projects created from my sample won't compile
